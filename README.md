# Structured Science

StructuredScience is a collection of templates and resources for organization scientific projects.

## Usage

As of right now, these templates and repositories are posted here for me to access, version control, and share to collaborators various templates that I use in my work.

They are all somewhat working-projects, but feel free to use them as you wish, and/or share other template resources you find useful.

## Templates

Templates and repositories on this organization include:

- A repository template for [generic projects](https://github.com/structuredscience/ProjectTemplate)
