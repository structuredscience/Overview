# Structured Science

StructuredScience is a collection of templates and resources for organizing scientific projects.

This collection is maintained by
[Tom Donoghue](https://tomdonoghue.github.io/),
and managed through the
[Github organization](https://github.com/structuredscience/).

## Overview

StructuredScience is a collection of guides and templates for organizing projects.

Note that all these resources continue to be developed as work evolves.

## Scope

The scope of 'StructuredScience' is broadly for scientific & computational projects.
Some of the materials are more specifically related to cognitive and computational neuroscience, with a focus on electrophysiology.

## Contents

This organization mainly contains templates for different kinds of projects.

Each template is stored as a separate repository.
To get started with a template, you can fork, clone, or download the repository, and use it to structure your project.

### Templates

Templates and repositories on this organization include are organized into different topics.

General templates for projects:

- A template directory structure for [generic projects](https://github.com/structuredscience/ProjectDirectoryTemplate)
- A repository template for [generic projects](https://github.com/structuredscience/ProjectTemplate)
- A template layout for [writing papers](https://github.com/structuredscience/PaperTemplate)

Templates for cognitive & computational projects:
- A repository template for [EEG projects](https://github.com/structuredscience/EEGTemplate)
- Template files for [behavioral tasks](https://github.com/structuredscience/TaskTemplate)

Templates for code projects:
- A template and resources for [developing modules](https://github.com/structuredscience/ModuleTemplate)

### Other Resources

The following is an list of other resources for template and related guides:

- The [openlists](https://github.com/openlists) collection of openly available resources
- The [Turing Way](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way) guide for data science projects

## Contributing
